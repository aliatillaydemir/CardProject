# Card Game

[ENG]
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate object-oriented programming principles and develop problem-solving skills by designing a simple card game consisting of 16 cards. The game, in which the player competes against the computer, will be played in two different categories: football and basketball. Each player has 8 cards (4 football players and 4 basketball players), and each category has 3 different match types (for football: free kick, penalty, one-on-one with the goalkeeper; for basketball: free throw, three-pointer, two-pointer). In each turn, a random match type from the active category will be selected, and the chosen players' attribute points will be compared. The score table will be updated accordingly, and the game will end when all cards have been used.
